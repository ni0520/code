# Haikus for Codespaces

This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based on the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!

## Notes Feature

This sample now includes a simple notes application. Visit `/notes` to create and view notes stored in `notes.json`.

Point your browser to [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) for a tour of using Codespaces with this repo.
